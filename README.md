# Noordhoff-PDF-Maker
This program can make PDF's of all Noordhoff Uitgevers e-books.  
It will download all of the pages individually and compress them into a usable PDF.

The documention below was made with an English browser and PC, but in Dutch the installion will be almost the same.

# Installing the program
First download the executable from the releases on the right of the page. For now it is only available on Windows (and it will probably stay that way). The Windows version the executable was tested on, is mentioned there.  

After downloading and running the file a Windows screen will pop-up. This is because the app is unrecognised and it will stay that way, because I don't want to pay Microsoft $500 per year.  

This pop-up can be ignored by clicking on "More info" and then "Run anyway"

The program will now run and show this screen:

A certain URL should be used as input here. How to obtain the URL is explained below.

# Retrieving the URL
Each Noordhoff book has a different URL. On the Noordhoff website, after selecting the book you want to download, a page will show up (shown below). On this page you will need to press "E-books".

After again selecting the rigth book. The page below will load. On this page you should click the icon that is encircled in red:

The page should now zoom in. Right click on this page and select "Copy image address":

Paste this address in the program and let it do it's magic; after a few seconds it will be done. Your PDF will be located in the folder you executed the program in. Most likely this will be the Download folder.
